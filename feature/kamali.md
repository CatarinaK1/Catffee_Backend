We at Team12 decided to make it possible for customers to buy online for our site. To achieve this objective, it was decided to create a membership form for customers. This will enable us to gather important information regarding the customers and create a database that serves several purposes.

Firstly, the database will store the menu items that are available on the website. This will make it easier for customers to browse through the menu and make selections based on their preferences.

Secondly, the database will store the information of users who have become members of our site. This information will include details such as their name, address, contact information, and other relevant details.

Thirdly, once customers log into their account, they will be able to place their orders from the menu. This will streamline the ordering process and ensure that orders are processed efficiently.

In addition to the above, the team has decided to offer a discount code to customers who order more than five times. This is aimed at encouraging customers to make repeat purchases and to foster customer loyalty.

Finally, We also decided to add a newsletter section to our site. This will allow customers to receive regular updates regarding new products and promotions, helping to keep them informed and engaged.

Considering the various tasks that need to be undertaken, it was decided that I would focus my attention on the database creation aspect of the project, specifically the menu section. I will also be providing support in other areas as needed.
